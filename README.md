# Analysis-with-R
Using R to run Exploratory Analysis

I ran an Exploratory Analysis observing the total number of surveys taken (1,109). Male: 530, Female: 589.

**Exploratory Analysis 1**
I created a new column conditioned less or greater than the mean of the
‘Physical Active Days’ using the ‘Physical Active Days’ column to create
categories ‘Barely Active’ and ‘Active’ under the new column ‘Activeness’. Visualized ‘Physical Activeness’ values against ‘BMI’ filtering with ‘Sex’. 
See Figure 1. below

**Exploratory Analysis 2**
I created a new column conditioned to less or greater than the mean value of 'Weight’ categorizing the new column ‘Over_weight’ into ‘Overweight’ and
‘Average Weight’.
The Exploratory analysis was to observe the relationship between ‘Weight’ and ‘BMI’. I plotted ‘Over-weight’ against ‘BMI’.
See Figure 2 below

**Exploratory Analysis 3**
My third exploratory analysis was to observe the average weight of smokers. Most especially if smoking at an early age increases the tendency to be an averagely-weighed person or overweight due to excessive food consumption.
I visualized ‘Over_weight’ against ‘SmokeAge’.
See Figure 3. Below.

**Hypothesis Test 1**
Two-Way ANOVA: testing for the group column ‘Sex’[Male & Female]’ against ‘Pulse pressure’.
This is a hypothesis stating that as Age increases so does the risk of having a heart attack from increased pulse pressure.

**Hypothesis Test 2**
Chi-test: testing for the column ‘SmokeNow’ and ‘Diabetes’. This is a
hypothesis stating that smokers are liable to have Diabetes.

**Hypothesis Test 3**
Linear regression (two-sample test): testing the column ‘Age’ and ‘Weight’
values but filtered showing data only for females. This is a hypothesis that
women older than 45 tend to be overweight than younger women.

DISCUSSION
-Summary of Exploratory Analysis 1.
● From Figure 1. A histogram shows the relationship between ‘Physical activeness’ and ‘BMI’ filtered with ‘Sex’.
●Barely active people tend to have higher BMI.
●The amount of days men are barely active is higher than the number of days men are active
●The percentage of barely active women is less than the percentage of active women.

-Summary of Exploratory Analysis 2:
● From Figure 2. A box plot is showing the relationship between ‘Weight
and BMI’
● People that are overweight i.e. have a weight greater than 83, have a
higher tendency to have high BMI.
● It is noticed that the maximum BMI for average-weighed people is
around 38, with no outliers.

-Summary of Exploratory Analysis 3
● From Figure 3. A box plot is showing the relationship between ‘Weight
and SmokeAge’
● Majority of average people weight started smoking at a
younger age. People who maintain an average weight are 
smokers with outliers above 40 years.
